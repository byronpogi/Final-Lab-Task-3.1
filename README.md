# Final-Lab-Task-3.1
In this activity, we utilize the usage of MySQL clauses to interact with a database by retrieving, organizing, and analyzing data from a structured table. By following the guide below:

Task 1: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve all courses where the number of students_enrolled is less than the enrollment_limit.

Task 2: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT, GROUP BY, and SUM functions to group courses by category and calculate the total number of enrolled students in each.

Task 3: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve courses where students_enrolled is equal to enrollment_limit, indicating full enrollment.

Task 4: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT and SUM function to calculate the total number of students enrolled across all courses.

Task 5: In this task, we are able to utilize the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses to sort the courses in ascending order based on students_enrolled.
